Non secured IP cam + image recognition AI + Google Maps

WIP

The idea is to educate people to security basics. Having a security camera is great. Allowing anyone to watch your children playing in your living room is scary.
Fear sometimes help people to learn.

webeye is a WIP software that crowls unsecured IP cam urls from https://insecam.org, detects what's being watched using https://clarifai.com image recognition AI, deduces where in the world is the video captured using http://ip-api.com, and combines these data in a simple Google Map.


No hacking stuff here, just combinated use of different tools to demonstrate importance of configuring passwords, and R-ingTFM.
