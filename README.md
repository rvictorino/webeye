Non secured IP cam + image recognition AI + Google Maps

WIP

The idea is to educate people to security basics. Having a security camera is great. Allowing anyone to watch your children playing in your living room is scary.
Fear sometimes help people to learn.

webeye is a WIP software that crowls unsecured IP cam urls from http://insecam.org, detects what's being watched using clarifai image recognition AI, detects where in the world is video captured and combine these data in a simple Google Map.
